(18, '2024-11-18 00:00:00', 2, 3, 'Why Consumers Are Returning to Global Brands?', 'Between 2023 and mid-2024, Pakistan witnessed a significant shift in consumer buying trends. Boycotts against Western brands, particularly in the fast-food and soft drink sectors, led to a decline in sales for multinational giants like McDonald’s, Pepsi, Coke, KFC, and Nestlé. This movement was fueled by public sentiment against Israel, prompting consumers to turn away from these brands in solidarity with Gaza.<p>Local businesses initially benefited from this shift, with consumers seeking homegrown alternatives. However, as the months passed, many consumers began gravitating back to the very brands they once vowed to avoid, revealing the challenges local businesses face in sustaining this shift.<p>While local businesses initially seized the opportunity, many struggled to maintain growth due to distribution challenges, inconsistent product quality, and limited online presence. In contrast, global brands have built robust supply chains, maintained rigorous quality control standards, and leveraged e-commerce systems, all of which made it easier for them to regain consumer trust.<p>The boycott presented a rare opportunity for local businesses to thrive, yet growth was limited. Data from the Large-Scale Manufacturing sector revealed only a 6.75% increase in beverage production from July 2023 to July 2024, a modest gain considering the rise in demand for domestic options.<p>Local manufacturers faced difficulties scaling up to meet this demand, citing issues such as inconsistent quality, weak distribution networks, and limited online presence. As inflation rose, local products were often priced similarly to their global counterparts but failed to deliver the same level of quality or value. This disparity led many consumers to return to established international brands, which offered greater reliability and trust.<p>The appeal of international brands lies in their unwavering commitment to stringent global standards. These companies invest heavily in certifications and protocols that ensure consistency, safety, and quality across markets. For instance, Lipton, Pakistan’s only international tea brand, operates under globally recognized certifications, including FSSC Ver 5.1 for comprehensive food safety, Halal certification issued by IFANCA, and Rainforest Alliance certification audited by Preferred by Nature, reflecting ethical and sustainable sourcing practices.<p>Similarly, Nestlé ensures all its factory labs in Pakistan are ISO 17025 accredited by the Pakistan National Accreditation Council under the Federal Ministry of Science & Technology. Additionally, its factories maintain international certifications such as FSSC 22000, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001-2008, and Halal, guaranteeing high-quality and food safety standards.<p>PepsiCo, too, upholds rigorous global protocols, with all its owned manufacturing facilities adhering to the Global Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System (GEHSMS). Many of these facilities also hold ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications, further underscoring PepsiCo’s commitment to sustainability and workplace safety.<p>This dedication to excellence is a hallmark of global brands. By ensuring consistent quality and compliance with international standards, these companies build long-term consumer trust—a trait that local alternatives have often struggled to replicate.<p>Another key differentiator for global brands is their commitment to corporate social responsibility. These companies don’t just deliver products—they actively invest in the communities they serve. Lipton, for instance, has made significant contributions to Pakistan’s economy and society. The brand employs over 1,300 people and supports two TCF schools in Khanewal, helping educate hundreds of children. Lipton’s healthcare initiatives have provided vital support to 10,000 women in rural Sindh and Balochistan, while its commitment to sustainability includes renewable energy use at its factories.<p>Similarly, Nestlé has installed water filtration systems at its manufacturing sites, ensuring access to clean drinking water for local communities. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, through their sustainability initiatives, continue to uplift communities while minimizing their environmental footprint. These efforts go beyond marketing—they reflect a deeper purpose, aligning the brand with the aspirations of the people it serves. For consumers, this dual promise of quality and community impact reinforces the enduring appeal of global brands.<p>The gradual return to international brands is not a failure of local enterprises but a reminder of the high bar set by global companies. For local brands to thrive, they must embrace similar commitments to quality, transparency, and social impact. The recent spotlight on local products represents a unique opportunity to improve and build trust. With the right focus on consistent quality, robust distribution, and meaningful community engagement, domestic brands can rise to meet consumer expectations.<p>The gradual return to international brands is not a failure of local businesses but a reflection of the high bar set by global competitors. For Pakistan’s domestic brands, this moment presents an opportunity to rise to the challenge. By delivering consistent quality, embracing innovation, and investing in their communities, they can position themselves as strong contenders in an increasingly competitive marketplace.<p>The story is no longer just about boycotts or brand loyalty—it’s about trust, value, and impact.

While admitting that the government “could have acted quicker,” Trudeau described the new immigration approach as “straightforward and simple.”<p>Trudeau made these comments in a seven-minute YouTube video released on Sunday, which included a montage of headlines highlighting flaws in Canada’s immigration system.<p><p>“Looking back, when the post-pandemic economic boom slowed, and businesses no longer required additional labor, as a federal team, we could have acted faster to close the taps,” Trudeau remarked in the video.<p>With the 2025 federal election on the horizon and his Liberal Party lagging in the polls, Trudeau is under increasing pressure from both the public and political opponents over immigration. Critics have linked higher immigration rates to worsening issues such as housing shortages and inflation.<p>Trudeau outlined the revised immigration plan, emphasizing its simplicity. The focus will now be on permanent residents with essential skills, particularly healthcare professionals and construction workers.<p>Under the new framework, Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents admitted, targeting 395,000 in 2025—a 20% decrease from the 485,000 projected for this year. Temporary immigration, including international students and foreign workers, will also see cuts, with annual numbers expected to drop to 446,000 by 2025 and 2026.

The proposed amendments have met significant resistance from Congress members which contributed to the postponement. <p>The most contentious proposal was to allow open elections for the PFF presidency, permitting any football-affiliated individual nominated by a Congress member to contest. This suggestion was swiftly dismissed by Congress members, who insisted on a narrower eligibility scope.<p>Currently, candidates for the presidency must meet stringent criteria: having held positions in PFF or related governing bodies for at least two of the last five years and securing nominations from two Congress members two months before the election. With the NC’s term expiring next month, FIFA and AFC pushed to waive the two-month deadline and reduce the nomination requirement to a single member.<p>Adding to the friction, Congress members voiced concerns over Haroon Malik referring to himself as the PFF president during the workshop, a title that has already drawn objections from the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB). <p>The Extraordinary Congress in Lahore also coincided with a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Inter-Provincial Coordination in Islamabad, where the NC has been summoned to provide updates on the electoral process.<p>Experts see this as a clear sign that PSB does not want the constitutional changes to pave the way for Haroon’s candidacy.<p>The details of the rescheduled PFF Extraordinary Congress Meeting shall be shared in due course.<p>', 'uploads/pff-3.jpg', 'Pakistan,Football,Federation,Extraordinary,Congress,Postponed');

Instruments like this have really helped Pakistan to mitigate the effects of climate disaster we faced in 2022 and feared in future,” he said <p>This preferential access was more than an economic boost, Ahsan Iqbal said, as it reflected a partnership based on shared values, human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and good governance.   <p>“By demonstrating our commitment to the 27 international conventions under the GSP-plus framework, Pakistan has positioned itself as a responsible and competitive global partner”, he said. <p>At the heart of Pakistan’s development vision, he said, was the 5Es framework, Exports, E-Pakistan, Environment and Climate Change, Energy and Infrastructure, Equity and Empowerment. “Among these pillars, export-led growth is our top priority and the GSP-plus schemes serve as vital drivers of this strategy”, he maintained. <p>The planning minister said the GSP-plus had enabled Pakistan to diversify its trade portfolio and enter new markets. “For exports to the EU accounted for nearly 33% our total exports in 2023 and this access has directly created millions of jobs, particularly in text, leather and agro-industries”, he added. <p>However, he said the potential was even greater to achieve the export-led growth target of $60 billion by 2030, adding “We must capitalize on GSP plus by moving up the value chains, producing high-end garments, sustainable goods and technology-driven products.” <p>“The GSP-s aligns with our digital vision where smart supply chains, e-commerce platforms and digital compliance mechanisms enable faster, transparent and more competitive exports,” he highlighted. <p>Ahsan Iqbal said environmental sustainability was a core focus of the GSP-plus conventions, from reducing industrial emissions to investing in green technologies. “Compliance with these standards enhances our global reputation and aligns with our broader commitment to combat climate change under our future Pakistan Vision 2047, which is under development,” he remarked. <p>', 'uploads/Port-Import-Export.jpg', 'Planning,Minister,Proposes,GSP-Plus,,Framework,Alignment,Export-Led,Growth '),

In a corporate briefing, the company discussed its financial performance for FY24 and outlined its future outlook.<p>During FY24, PNSC posted a consolidated topline of Rs. 46 billion, reflecting a year-on-year (YoY) decline of 15 percent, primarily due to a 48 percent YoY drop in the dry cargo segment attributed to reduced average charter rates. Slot charter operations fell by 33 percent YoY as government consignments declined, with no business received from the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP), which had contributed approximately Rs. 2.8 billion during the previous fiscal year. Despite these challenges, revenue from the liquid cargo segment remained stable at Rs. 40 billion.<p>Other income declined by 17 percent YoY, impacted by the absence of gains from vessel disposals (approximately Rs. 3.3 billion in FY23) and a lack of exchange gains amid a stable currency. Management, however, anticipates improved demand in the current year, supported by the dry bulk segment and new break-bulk orders from the government.<p>PNSC plans to replace four of its five Aframax vessels, which are 18–19 years old. International tenders have been floated, with bids received from the UK, China, and other shipyards. Contract finalization is expected by the end of CY24. Under the State-Owned Enterprises Act 2023, PNSC is now permitted to formulate its procurement policies in line with international shipping industry practices, pending federal cabinet approval.<p>The new vessels will comply with the International Maritime Organization’s emission reduction targets, including a 20 percent reduction by 2030, 70 percent by 2040, and net-zero emissions by 2050. These tankers will feature internally coated tanks, enabling them to carry both dirty and clean liquids, thus enhancing market acceptance.<p>PNSC plans to finance the purchase using a mix of equity and debt, with 80 percent of the transaction cost expected to be debt-financed. The cost of brand-new or under-construction Aframax tankers, with signed contracts for early delivery, is estimated at $85 million each, while new-built contracts range from $73 million to $75 million. Regulatory requirements preclude the acquisition of vessels older than five years. Currently, used Aframax vessels are priced at around $12 million, with a scrap value of $7–10 million.<p>The company also aims to sustain its dry dock operations, with five vessels scheduled for maintenance. One tanker vessel will be out of operation for 40–45 days, while four dry bulk vessels will undergo dry docking for 25–35 days.<p>The current fleet includes Aframax vessels that are 18–19 years old, LR-1s aged 12 years, and dry bulk carriers aged 16–17 years.

Students are increasingly using generative AI for assignments and exams, submitting chatbot-generated work as their own to earn grades, credits, and even degrees.<p>New research from the U.K. reinforces a critical concern: teachers are largely unable to detect AI-generated academic work.<p>The increasing use of AI to complete academic work poses a significant threat to the value of high school diplomas and college degrees. It also raises serious concerns about unqualified individuals entering critical professions like nursing, engineering, and firefighting, where a lack of genuine knowledge could have dire consequences.<p>Alarmingly, some schools have exacerbated the problem by permitting AI usage while prohibiting the very technology designed to detect it, effectively encouraging academic dishonesty.<p>A study by Peter Scarfe and colleagues at the University of Reading, U.K., reveals a concerning inability of educators to identify AI-generated work. Researchers submitted basic AI-generated assignments under fake student profiles, and a staggering 97% went undetected. Even more troubling, the report suggests this 6% detection rate is likely inflated compared to real-world cheating scenarios.<p>Here is what the report said:<p>Overall, AI submissions verged on being undetectable, with 94% not being detected. If we adopt a stricter criterion for “detection” with a need for the flag to mention AI specifically, 97% of AI submissions were undetected.<p>The difficulty in identifying AI-generated text isn’t new.

This formula aims to promote fairness and address longstanding tensions between the two boards.<p>While the BCCI initially showed interest in the neutral venue proposal for the Champions Trophy, progress has been slow.

Revealed during Miami Art Week, the Type 00 concept marks a dramatic departure from Jaguar’s traditional designs, offering a vision of the company’s new electric era.<p>The Type 00 concept car blends elements of Jaguar’s past with its future. Its name pays homage to the iconic “Type” designation used in past Jaguar models, while the two zeros represent the brand’s commitment to sustainability and its rebirth as an electric vehicle maker. The car’s design features sharp edges and a futuristic, almost robotic look, moving away from the classic smooth curves Jaguar is known for.<p>The car’s exterior is defined by a bold, monolithic presence. The front end features a blunt grill with horizontal elements, flanked by angular headlights formed by a continuous LED line. The side of the car showcases innovative design, including rear-facing cameras instead of traditional side mirrors and a sleek fastback profile. The rear is equally striking, with a large rectangular panel and concealed taillights, further accentuating the car’s dramatic look. The panoramic glass roof adds to its futuristic appeal.<p>Inside, the cabin is a showcase of luxury and innovation. The design is inspired by architecture and home decor, with brass elements and a unique central spine running through the length of the cabin. The cabin features two large screens that rise beside the spine, but these can be hidden for a more serene experience. In place of traditional materials, the interior uses wool textile blends and travertine stone, offering a more sustainable approach to luxury.<p>The concept also introduces the idea of “totems,” small objects that alter the car’s ambient lighting, sounds, and scents, adding a personalized touch to the driving experience. Each totem is made from a different material — brass, travertine, and alabaster — and can be customized to suit the owner’s preferences.<p>Jaguar has opted for a minimalist approach to branding. The new “Jaguar” font is featured on the front grill, while the iconic “leaper” logo is engraved on the brass trim. These subtle design choices reflect the brand’s aim to be recognized by its distinctive design rather than oversized logos.<p>While Type 00 is a design concept not meant for production, it gives us a strong sense of what to expect from Jaguar’s future electric vehicles. The concept will likely influence Jaguar’s first production electric car, a four-door grand tourer, due to launch in 2026. Jaguar has mentioned that the Grand Tourer will offer a captivating driving experience, with a target range of 430 miles per charge.<p>The Type 00 concept is in two color variations: “Miami Pink,” a bold, Art Deco-inspired shade, and “London Blue,” reflecting the brand’s British roots. Though not directly related to a production model, the Type 00 concept marks a bold new direction for Jaguar, merging iconic design with the innovation of electric mobility.<p>', 'uploads/main-.jpg', 'Jaguar,Unveils,Radical-Looking,Type,Concept,Electric');

The company will showcase them in a teaser format, likely through a video or image, much like the preview of the Galaxy Ring at Unpacked earlier this year.<p>Industry sources suggest that they could release the finalized version of the XR glasses in the third quarter of 2025, likely between July and September, although they won’t be ready for sale at the event. This indicates that Samsung is following a similar strategy to its earlier product launches, with teasers building anticipation before a full reveal.<p>The glasses are expected to weigh only 50g and resemble a standard pair of eyeglasses. They will come with several smart features, including a payment function, AI integration, facial recognition (likely for payments), and gesture control for navigating the user interface.<p>Developed in collaboration with Google and Qualcomm since February 2023, the XR glasses will likely be part of Samsung’s broader push into augmented and virtual reality.<p>The company is planning to announce its XR software platform, which will power the smart glasses, and reveal the glasses by the end of this month. With this development, Samsung is aiming to expand its ecosystem further into the world of XR technology.<p>', 'uploads/Samsung-XR-Smart-Glasses-e1733301555158.jpg', 'Samsung’s,Glasses,Teased,January,2025'),
(132, '2024-12-04 00:00:00', 4, 3, 'Lahore Qalandars Edge Victoria in a Thriller at GSL 2024', 'The Lahore Qalandars registered a thrilling 10-run victory over Victoria in the Global Super League (GSL) 2024 clash at Providence, keeping their hopes alive in the competition. A stellar bowling performance from Tabraiz Shamsi proved pivotal in a game that remained on a knife’s edge until the very end.<p>Victoria’s captain Corey Anderson won the toss and opted to field, a decision that initially seemed to pay off. Lahore’s innings was anchored by Mirza Baig, who scored a composed 39 off 36 balls. However, the Qalandars failed to build any lasting momentum as wickets kept falling at regular intervals.<p>Mohammad Faizan added 25 off 21 before being run out, while Tom Abell (17) and Mohammad Akhlaq (26) made brief contributions. Captain Carlos Brathwaite couldn’t steady the ship, falling for a golden duck to Jackson Smith.<p>Victoria’s bowlers were clinical, with Jackson Smith and Dominic Drakes taking three wickets each. Drakes, in particular, was instrumental, bowling 14 dot balls in his four-over spell and applying relentless pressure. The Qalandars were eventually dismissed for 139, leaving Victoria with a seemingly manageable target of 140 runs.<p>Victoria started strongly, with openers Blake Macdonald and Joe Clarke putting together a 67-run partnership. They looked set to cruise to victory, but the Qalandars clawed their way back into the contest with regular breakthroughs.<p>The turning point came when Tabraiz Shamsi unleashed a masterclass in spin bowling. Shamsi was unplayable, taking 3 wickets for just 11 runs in his four overs. His spell included 16 dot balls and not a single boundary conceded, completely stifling Victoria’s momentum.<p>Victoria’s hopes rested on Karima Gore, who fought hard with 25 off 22 balls. But his dismissal in the penultimate over left the Australian side with just two wickets and 12 runs to get in the final over.<p>Faheem Ashraf held his nerve, dismissing Jackson Smith on his third delivery to secure a 10-run win for the Qalandars. The victory marked a significant turnaround after Victoria’s strong start and highlighted the importance of Shamsi’s exceptional spell.<p>The result has left the GSL standings finely poised, with Lahore Qalandars, Victoria, and Guyana Amazon Warriors all tied on four points, each having won two matches and lost one. The next round of games will be crucial in determining which teams advance to the final.<p>For now, the Qalandars’ victory serves as a reminder of their ability to deliver under pressure, with Tabraiz Shamsi’s performance standing out as a defining moment in the tournament.<p> <p>', 'uploads/qalandars.jpg', 'Lahore,Qalandars,Edge,Victoria,Thriller,2024');
